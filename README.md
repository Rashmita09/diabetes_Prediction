# diabetes_Prediction
The data collected is PIMA diabetes dataset from kaggle. Using python and some of its packages, the file was imported and manipulated. The data is cleaned and standardized and is split for testing and training. Here two methods are used: SVM classifier and KNN and KNN gives the highest accuracy among the two. Finally the model predicts whether the person has diabetes or not.
